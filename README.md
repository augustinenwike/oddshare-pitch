# *OddShare*

*OddShare is a trustless parimutuel prediction market protocol built on Aptos.*
Through decentralized smart contracts, anyone can create, participate in, and resolve prediction markets on any outcome — *no central authority required*.

Our infrastructure democratizes forecasting for *communities, DAOs, sports enthusiasts, crypto traders*, and any individual who wants to participate in transparent, blockchain-based prediction markets.

## 🚨 *The Problem*

Traditional prediction markets are *centralized, opaque, and unfair*, especially for users seeking trustless alternatives to conventional betting platforms.

They suffer from:

* *Centralized control* over market creation and fund management
* *Lack of transparency* in odds calculation and outcome verification
* *Geographic restrictions* and complex KYC requirements
* *Gaming and manipulation* through front-running and information asymmetry
* *Limited market options* — platforms only cover mainstream events

Every crypto user, DAO, and community wants transparent forecasting tools —
*but the infrastructure doesn't exist.*

## 🌍 *Our Vision*

We are building the *infrastructure layer for decentralized prediction markets on Aptos.*

By abstracting away complexity and offering transparent parimutuel primitives, we enable any community — anywhere — to create trustless forecasting markets on any outcome.

*Communities stay in control:*
Which markets they create, how they resolve, and what parameters they set.

*We provide the rails. They drive the markets.*

*One prediction at a time, we are making Aptos the global forecasting engine.*
